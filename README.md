# AngularBookStore

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Setup 
As Angular 8 requires Node 12+, let us download Node 12.5 from the official website and install it. Once Node 12+ is installed, we have NPM 6.9 available. 

install angular/cli

npm uninstall -g @angular/cli    #Uninstall the previous version
npm cache clean
npm install -g @angular/cli  #install latest version of angular/cli

run ng build on project 

then final run ng serve
